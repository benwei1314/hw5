First idea, I want to recreate the game called Breakout. Control a rectangle pad sliding left and right using a mouse.
To start game, you launch the ball. The ball bounches when it touches blocks, screen, and the control pad. 
Game ends when pad fails to catch ball. When ball touche the block it breaks and makes a sound.

Second idea, I want to recreate the game Snake. Control snake using arrows. 
Random apple is placed. When snake eats an apple it grows longer. 
When snake touches the side of the wall or touch it's own tail the game ends.
Makes a sound when apple is eaten and gameover sound.
I want to make the game more difficult by adding obstables such as randomly placed shapes.

Third idea, I want to recreate Flappybird. Use mouse click to fly the bird.
The bird continue to fall. The goal is go though the rectangle.
The rectangle on screen continues to move left. It speeds up. Game over when bird touches the rectangle.
Makes sound each time bird flies, goes through the rectangle, and gameover sound.
